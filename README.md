# stress-o-meter

Stress detection signs by taking a single photo - An AI building idea for Elements of AI course.

## Summary

The main idea is take an employee single photo and detect stress levels sending an alarm sign to him/her and to the employer and they can take precautionary measures only if the outcome is stress-positive.

## Background

The idea is get alarm signals if the workers are in a high stress level that the organization aren't detecting.

This topic is important to try to prevent future psicologic/psiquiatrich diseases that they are of long treatment.


## How is it used?

The process is very simple: at the attendance point, there is a device that is taking a photo to mark de presence of the employee, the same photo will pass to the IA process to detect stress signs. The same process can be used at the end of the day.

If a sign of stress is detected, depends on stress level (the threshold will be defined by a medical professional previously), then fire a alert to HR people to letting know this situation.


## Data sources and AI methods
The main data will come directly from the attendance device. The training set, will be taken from the common databases like Shustterstock, iStock, Dreamstime, etc. And a part of the pictures collected, they will be a test set.

## Challenges

This project does not replace the specialist consult (medical, psichological, psichiatric, and so on). Only is a tool to warning the HR people for potential future employee diseases that are in constant stress.
